              <Glow glowClassName="bg-white">rapidl</Glow> was born out of my
              own experience as a resource-constrained student. Faced with a
              limited number of past papers in the new specification, I found
              myself at a disadvantage.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sure, I could refer to the old specification, but encountering
              unfamiliar concepts left me puzzled and wasted my time. Even
              consulting the mark scheme felt like a spoiler, especially when it
              turned out to be something I should have known.
              <br />
              <br />
              That's why I created <Glow glowClassName="bg-white">
                rapidl
              </Glow>{" "}
              â€” a project designed to address these challenges head-on. Its
              primary goal is to cater to the new specification, providing a
              wide range of subjects to explore. With{" "}
              <Glow glowClassName="bg-white">rapidl</Glow>, you'll have access
              to an extensive collection of unique revision resources, ensuring
              that you never run out of valuable study materials.

              While <Glow glowClassName="bg-white">rapidl</Glow> offers randomly
              generated resources, it is crucial to note that these should not
              be solely relied upon as your sole revision material. This service
              is specifically tailored for individuals who are seeking an
              additional means to challenge themselves in preparation for their
              upcoming examinations. It is strongly recommended to supplement
              your studies with comprehensive resources and materials to ensure
              a well-rounded and thorough understanding of the subject matter.
